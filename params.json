  "body": "# Multiload-ng\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nMultiload-ng is a modern graphical system monitor. It's a near-complete rewrite of the good old GNOME multiload applet.\r\n\r\nIt supports the following panels:\r\n- XFCE (xfce4-panel)\r\n- LXDE (lxpanel)\r\n- MATE (mate-panel)\r\n- Standalone (has its own window, not embedded in any panel)\r\n\r\nMultiload-ng can be built with GTK2 and GTK3, so can be embedded within GTK2/GTK3 builds of all the panels above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Draw graphs of system resources\r\n- Very customizable\r\n- Color schemes support\r\n- Automatically adapts to container changes (panel or window)\r\n- Written in pure C with few dependencies - little CPU/memory footprint\r\n- Customizable tooltips\r\n- Custom mouse actions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![Default configuration, small panel.

All additional documentation is located in the [Wiki](../../wiki).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## History\r\nMultiload-ng started as a simple port of multiload-nandhp to lxpanel>0.7.\r\nAs I become familiar with code, I started making other little changes, and cleaning the code.\r\nI then contacted original author, but received no reply - meanwhile the plugin continued improving.\r\n\r\nThis came to the point where the changes became many and deep, and I realized that this wasn't the same project anymore.\r\nI knew that a fresh start would give a boost to development, and at the same time it\r\nwould allow to choose future directions with more ease.\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons, I made Multiload-ng a separate project.\r\nThe name changes too (so the filenames), in order to allow them to be installed together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## System Requirements\r\n#### Common requirements\r\nThese are the packages required to build any version of the plugin.\r\nSee per-panel section below for full list.\r\n\r\nPackage                     | Min version\r\n:-------------------------- | -------------:\r\ngtk+                        | >= 2.18.0\r\ncairo                       | >= 1.0\r\nlibgtop                     | >= 2.11.92\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for standalone window\r\nStandalone target has no additional requirements.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for LXDE panel\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build LXDE panel plugin:\r\n\r\nPackage                     | Min version\r\n:-------------------------- | -------------:\r\nlxpanel                     | >= 0.7.0\r\nlibfm                       | >= 1.2.0\r\n\r\nDue to an error in lxpanel source, if you are using lxpanel 0.7.0 you will\r\nneed also libmenu-cache. This was fixed in version 0.7.1. Read about this\r\n[here](http://wiki.lxde.org/en/How_to_write_plugins_for_LXPanel#Preconditions).\r\n\r\nYou will have to force GTK+2 build (see [here](#gtk-version) for instructions).\r\n\r\nNote that LXDE 0.7 or greater is required.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for MATE panel\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build MATE panel plugin:\r\n\r\nPackage                     | Min version\r\n:-------------------------- | -------------:\r\nlibmatepanelapplet-4        | >= 1.7.0\r\n\r\nCheck which GTK+ version is supported by your panel: mate-panel used to be GTK+2,\r\nnewer versions of mate-panel are GTK+3. You may have to set correct GTK+ version\r\n(see [here](#gtk-version) for instructions).\r\n\r\nNote that MATE 1.7 or greater is required.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for XFCE panel\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build XFCE panel plugin:\r\n\r\nPackage                     | Min version\r\n:-------------------------- | -------------:\r\nlibxfce4panel               | >= 4.6.0\r\nlibxfce4util                | >= 4.6.0\r\nlibxfce4ui-1 OR libxfcegui4 | >= 4.8.0\r\n\r\nCheck which GTK+ version is supported by your panel: xfce4-panel used to be GTK+2\r\nonly, newer versions of xfce4-panel supports GTK+3 too. You may have to set\r\ncorrect GTK+ version (see [here](#gtk-version) for instructions).\r\n\r\nNote that XFCE 4.6 or greater is required.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for temperature graph\r\nThis is not a build-time requirement, rather a run-time one. The plugin search\r\nsysfs nodes corresponding to thermal zones, chooses the hottest one and draws it\r\nin the graph. The only requirement here is a Linux kernel compiled with\r\n`CONFIG_THERMAL (Generic Thermal sysfs driver)`. Any modern kernel (since 2010)\r\nsets it automatically, so it should be just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Build instructions\r\n\r\n#### Get the source\r\nExecute the following command line (you must have git installed):  \r\n`git clone https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng`\r\n\r\nIf you don't have git, download the lastest source ZIP [here](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/archive/master.zip).\r\n\r\nOr, if you don't want any surprise, download a stable release [here](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/releases).\r\n\r\n#### Configure\r\nMove to the directory that contains source code just cloned and run:  \r\n`./autogen.sh`\r\n\r\nNow run configure script:  \r\n`./configure --prefix=/usr`  \r\nChange prefix as needed (/usr is the default of most distros and it's just OK; if not specified it defaults to /usr/local).\r\n\r\nLubuntu users (and possibly others) have different libraries location. They may have to set directly *libdir*:  \r\n`./configure --libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`  \r\nIf plugin does not show up in the list of panel plugins, you could try to repeat build process with this configure setting.\r\n\r\n#### GTK version\r\nBuild system automatically selects highest GTK+ version available. If you need to build against a lower version, you have to\r\nset it manually (see next section, [Advanced configure](#advanced-configure))\r\n\r\nFor example, XFCE and LXDE users need GTK2 version of the plugin. They need to add option `--with-gtk=2.0` to *./configure*.\r\n\r\n#### Advanced configure\r\nIf you are ok with default settings, you can skip this paragraph and head to [Build](#build) section. Otherwise, continue reading.\r\n\r\nConfigure script automatically detects installed panels (and related development packages) and enables panel plugins accordingly. You can force enable/disable them using `--with-PLUGIN`, `--without-PLUGIN` or `--with-PLUGIN=yes|no` (replace `PLUGIN` accordingly)\r\n\r\nMultiload-ng's ./configure has some extra options:  \r\n\r\nOption                      | Description                          | Note\r\n--------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------\r\n`--with-gtk=2.0|3.0|auto`   | GTK+ version to compile against      | Remember to set same GTK+ version of the target panel! Otherwise you could get linking or runtime errors.\r\n`--disable-deprecations`    | Disable GDK/GTK deprecation warnings | Useful when build system enforces *-Werror*. Some deprecated symbols does not have adequate replacement yet.\r\n`--enable-experimental`     | Compile in experimental code         | May be unstable/malfunctioning. Only for testing/developing purposes.\r\n`--enable-debug`            | Allows debugging with GDB            | This enables required CFLAGS.\r\n`--enable-profiling`        | Allows profiling with gprof          | This enables required CFLAGS\r\n\r\nTo get a list of all available options, type:  \r\n`./configure --help`\r\n\r\nWhen you are satisfied with your flags, run `./configure` with selected options.\r\n\r\n#### Build\r\nThis is simple. Move to the directory that contains source code and execute:  \r\n`make`\r\n\r\n#### Install/uninstall\r\nTo install (must run `make` before), execute:  \r\n`sudo make install`\r\n\r\nTo later uninstall you need source directory. If you deleted it, just download again, and run [Configure](#configure) part. Then execute:  \r\n`sudo make uninstall`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\nYou can contribute in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Suggest new features\r\n* Report bugs\r\n* Translate to new languages\r\n* Port the plugin to other panels\r\n* Implement something present in the [Wishlist](../../wiki/Wishlist)\r\n* Fix something present in [Known issues and TODO](../../wiki/Known-issues-and-TODO)\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nLook at the [Wiki](../../wiki), contains all the informations you will need.\r\n\r\nEach pull request will be considered and will get a response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Q: Which are the differences with original Multiload applet?\r\nA: First of all, this project is *forked* from original Multiload. Multiload-ng has ALL the features of the original multiload, since they share the same codebase.\r\n\r\nThere are some notable differences:\r\n\r\n* Original multiload contains old and unmantained code, Multiload-ng is actively mantained\r\n* Multiload-ng has a [Wiki](../../wiki)!\r\n* Multiload-ng runs on a variety of panels, including those of the original multiload\r\n* Multiload-ng has additional graphs, and more will be added in the future\r\n* Multiload-ng has more graphical customizations, like individual size/interval/border\r\n* Multiload-ng has color schemes support\r\n* Multiload-ng responds to mouse events with per-graph customizable actions\r\n* Multiload-ng can choose its orientation regardless of panel orientation\r\n* Multiload-ng has higher limits for graph size and update interval\r\n* Multiload-ng can also be run without any panel\r\n* ...and so on\r\n\r\nTry it in your system and you won't come back!\r\n\r\n#### Q: I tried to compile plugin for *\\[insertyourpanelhere\\]*, but it shows just a vertical blank line. Why?\r\nA: Probably you compiled against the wrong GTK version. E.g: XFCE and LXDE panels are still GTK2-based, and\r\nMultiload-ng build system automatically selects GTK3 if available.\r\n\r\nTry running Configure with the right options (see [Configure](#configure) section above)\r\n\r\n#### Q: Doesn't a system monitor use system resources by itself?\r\nA: Yes. This is true for every system monitor. That's why resources usage from Multiload-ng is kept to a negligible level.\r\n\r\n#### Q: I found a bug! How can I report?\r\nA: The preferred way to report a bug is by [creating a new issue](../../issues/new).\r\n\r\nFirst, check wether the bug is already present in [issues list](../../issues) or in the appropriate [wiki page](../../wiki/Known-issues-and-TODO).\r\nIf it's not, you should [create a new issue](../../issues/new).\r\n\r\n#### Q: I have a suggestion that could be useful. How can I report?\r\nA: The preferred way to suggest a new features is by [creating a new issue](../../issues/new).\r\n\r\nFirst, check wether your suggestion is already present in [issues list](../../issues) or in the project [Wishlist](../../wiki/Wishlist).\r\nIf it's not, you should [create a new issue](../../issues/new).\r\n\r\n#### Q: Will you continue the development of Multiload-ng?\r\nA: Of course! To get an idea of future directions, take a look at the [Wishlist](../../wiki/Wishlist).\r\n\r\n#### Q: Why don't you port to panel *\\[insertyourpanelhere\\]*?\r\nA: Because of a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I don't have the time -> Will be done when I find some time\r\n2. I don't have required knowledge -> Will be done when I learn it\r\n3. I didn't know that *\\[insertyourpanelhere\\]* existed/supported plugins -> Now I know, I'll investigate and eventually you will have your plugin\r\n4. Requires too much work -> If it's worth it, see #1\r\n5. Requires plugins to be written in languages other than C -> Sorry, this would break ALL existing plugins. Unless special cases (like supersets of C or simple wrappers), it's very likely it can't be done.\r\n\r\nThe best way to get a new port is to suggest it (or code it yourself, of course). Feel free to submit an issue about your request, it will be considered carefully.\r\n",
