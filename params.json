  "body": "# Multiload-ng\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nMultiload-ng is a near-complete rewrite of the good old GNOME multiload applet.\r\n<!--TODO plugin screenshots, into all panels - change shape and colors too, to illustrate every possibility-->\r\n<!--TODO screenshot of preferences window too-->\r\nIt has plugins for the following panels:\r\n- XFCE 4 (xfce4-panel)\r\n- LXDE (lxpanel)\r\n- MATE (mate-panel)\r\n\r\nIn addition it can be built as a standalone window, that is, not embedded in any panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Draw graphs of system resources\r\n- Very customizable\r\n- Automatically adapts to container changes (panel or window)\r\n- Written in pure C with few dependencies - little CPU/memory footprint\r\n- Custom actions on double click\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Graphs\r\n#### CPU Graph\r\nDraws CPU usage, differentiating between User/System/Nice/IOWait.\r\n#### Memory Graph\r\nDraws RAM usage, differentiating between memory used by the applications\r\n(directly and through shared modules) and memory used as cache/buffers.\r\n#### Network Graph\r\nDraws network I/O of every supported network interface, differentiating\r\nbetween input, output and local (loopback, adb, etc) traffic.\r\n#### Swap Graph\r\nDraws swap usage, when detected.\r\n#### Load Average Graph\r\nDraws load average, as returned by `uptime`.\r\n#### Disk Graph\r\nDraws Disk I/O, differentiating between read and write.\r\n#### Temperature Graph\r\nDraws temperature of the system, based on the hottest temperature\r\ndetected among the supported sensors in the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## History\r\nMultiload-ng started as a simple port of nandhp's source to lxpanel>0.7.\r\n\r\nAs I become familiar with code, I started making other little changes, and cleaning the code.\r\nI then contacted original author, but received no reply - meanwhile the plugin continued improving.\r\n\r\nThis came to the point where the changes became many and deep, and I realized that this wasn't the same project anymore.\r\n\r\nI knew that a fresh start would give a boost to development, and at the same time it\r\nwould allow to choose future directions with more ease.\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons, I made Multiload-ng a separate project.\r\nThe name changes too (so the filenames), in order to allow them to be installed together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## System Requirements\r\n#### Common requirements\r\nThese are the packages required to build any version of the plugin.\r\nSee per-panel section below for full list.\r\n\r\nPackage                     | Min version\r\n:-------------------------- | -------------:\r\ngtk+                        | >= 2.18.0\r\ncairo                       | >= 1.0\r\nlibgtop                     | >= 2.11.92\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for XFCE4 panel\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build XFCE4 panel plugin:\r\n\r\nPackage                     | Min version\r\n:-------------------------- | -------------:\r\nlibxfce4panel               | >= 4.6.0\r\nlibxfce4util                | >= 4.6.0\r\nlibxfce4ui-1 OR libxfcegui4 | >= 4.8.0\r\n\r\nNote that XFCE 4.6 or greater is required.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for LXDE panel\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build LXDE panel plugin:\r\n\r\nPackage                     | Min version\r\n:-------------------------- | -------------:\r\nlxpanel                     | >= 0.7.0\r\nlibfm                       | >= 1.2.0\r\n\r\nDue to an error in lxpanel source, if you are using lxpanel 0.7.0 you will\r\nneed also libmenu-cache. This was fixed in version 0.7.1. Read about this\r\n[here](http://wiki.lxde.org/en/How_to_write_plugins_for_LXPanel#Preconditions).\r\n\r\nNote that LXDE 0.7 or greater is required.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for MATE panel\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build MATE panel plugin:\r\n\r\nPackage                     | Min version\r\n:-------------------------- | -------------:\r\nlibmatepanelapplet-4        | >= 1.7.0\r\n\r\nNote that MATE 1.7 or greater is required.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for temperature graph\r\nThis is not a build-time requirement, rather a run-time one. The plugin search\r\nsysfs nodes corresponding to thermal zones, chooses the hottest one and draws it\r\nin the graph. The only requirement here is a Linux kernel compiled with\r\n`CONFIG_THERMAL (Generic Thermal sysfs driver)`. Any modern kernel (since 2010)\r\nsets it automatically, so it should be just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Build instructions\r\n\r\n#### Get the source\r\nExecute the following command line (you must have git installed):  \r\n`git clone https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng`\r\n\r\nIf you don't have git, download the source ZIP [here](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/archive/master.zip).\r\n\r\n#### Configure\r\nMove to the directory that contains source code just cloned and run:  \r\n`./autogen.sh`\r\n\r\nNow run configure script:  \r\n`./configure --prefix=/usr`\r\nChange prefix as needed (/usr is the default of most distros and it's just OK; if not specified it defaults to /usr/local).\r\n\r\nConfigure script automatically detects installed panels (and related development packages) and enables panel plugins accordingly.  \r\nYou can force enable/disable for some panels (and standalone). To learn how, along with other available options, type:  \r\n`./configure --help`\r\n\r\nThen run `./configure` with selected options.\r\n\r\n#### Build\r\nThis is simple. Move to the directory that contains source code and execute:  \r\n`make`\r\n\r\n#### Install/uninstall\r\nTo install (must run `make` before), execute:  \r\n`sudo make install`\r\n\r\nTo later uninstall you need source directory. If you deleted it, just download again, and run *Configure* part. Then execute:  \r\n`sudo make uninstall`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\nYou can contribute in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Suggest new features\r\n* Translate to new languages\r\n* Port the plugin to other panels\r\n* Report bugs\r\n* Implement something present in the [Wishlist](../../wiki/Wishlist)\r\n* Fix something present in [Known issues and TODO](../../wiki/Known-issues-and-TODO)\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nLook at the [Wiki](../../wiki), contains all the informations you will need.\r\n\r\nEach pull request will be considered and will get a response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Q: Which are the differences with original Multiload applet?\r\nA: First of all, this project is *forked* from original Multiload, so they share the same base. There are some notable differences:\r\n\r\n* Original multiload contains old and unmantained code, Multiload-ng is actively mantained\r\n* Multiload-ng is very well documented (see [Wiki](../../wiki))\r\n* Multiload-ng has additional graphs, and more will be added in the future\r\n* Multiload-ng has more graphical customizations, like individual colored border\r\n* Multiload-ng has color themes support\r\n* Multiload-ng responds to mouse events with customizable actions\r\n* Multiload-ng can choose its orientation regardless of panel orientation\r\n* Multiload-ng can also be run without any panel\r\n* ...and so on\r\n\r\nTry it in your system and you won't regret!\r\n\r\n#### Q: Doesn't a system monitor use system resources by itself?\r\nA: Yes. This is true for every system monitor. That's why resources usage from Multiload-ng is kept to a negligible level.\r\n\r\n#### Q: I found a bug! How can I report?\r\nA: First, check wether this bug is already present in [issues list](../../issues) or in the appropriate [wiki page](../../wiki/Known-issues-and-TODO).\r\n\r\nIf not, you can then [create a new issue](../../issues/new) or add the bug you found in the [Known issues and TODO wiki page](../../wiki/Known-issues-and-TODO).\r\n\r\n#### Q: I have a suggestion that could be useful. How can I report?\r\nA: First, check wether your suggestion is already present in [this list](../../wiki/Wishlist).\r\n\r\nIf not, you can then add your suggestion in the [Wishlist wiki page](../../wiki/Wishlist).\r\n\r\n",
