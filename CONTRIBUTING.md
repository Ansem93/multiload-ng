## How Can I Contribute?

You can contribute to Multiload-ng in many ways.


### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through reporting a bug in Multiload-ng. Following these guidelines helps maintainers to speed up bug fixing process.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). If you'd like, you can use [this template](#template-for-submitting-bug-reports) to structure the information.


#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- The bug may have been already solved in development code, and you might just need to wait until next release. Before reporting a bug, build lastest version of Multiload-ng from git source and check whether the bug is still there.
- Read the [Help & Troubleshooting section](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/blob/master/README.md#help--troubleshooting) of Multiload-ng README for common issues and how to solve them
- Check in the list of [open issues](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) to see if the issue you are describing has already been reported. If it has, add comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.



#### How To Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bug reports are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on Multiload-ng repository and provide the following information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) to record GIFs on Linux.
- **You can use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)**.
- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

- **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Multiload-ng) or was this always a problem?
- If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Multiload-ng?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Multiload-ng from [the releases page](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/releases).
- **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

- **Which version of Multiload-ng are you using**?
- **Are you using Multiload-ng inside a panel**? If so, provide panel name and version.
- **Are you using a native plugin**? (e.g. XFCE, MATE or LXDE panel plugin) Or is it a generic one? (that is, not tied to a particular panel, like AppIndicator, System Tray, Standalone)
- **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
- **What is the architecture of your CPU**? (32/64 bit - output of `uname -a` can be useful)
- **Are you running Multiload-ng in a virtual machine**? If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
- **Everything else you think it's relevant**. Often, it is.

For some specific categories of bugs, there is some data that will help developers to better understand the problem. This can be a file or the output of a command
You should include these files in your bug report, either attaching them to the issue or linking from a pastebin. Here is the list:

Issue type			| Useful data
:---------			| :----------
Build error			| contents of `config.log` (located in your build directory)
Battery graph		| output of `ls -laR /sys/class/power_supply /sys/class/power_supply/*/`
Temperature graph	| output of `ls -laR /sys/class/hwmon /sys/class/thermal /sys/class/hwmon/*/ /sys/class/thermal/*/`

### Code Contributions

You can contribute to Multiload-ng with your coding skills, by closing an existing open issue.

Begin by searching [all open issues with 'help-wanted' label](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
Those issues are waiting for you to fix them!

You can also help a lot by just adding a useful comment to an open issue, to give code snippets, hints, usecases, ...).



### Pull Requests

- Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
- Follow the [C](#c-styleguide) and [Translations](#translations-styleguide) styleguides.
- You can use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).



### Translations

Translators are highly welcome! Translating Multiload-ng into new languages will help it to reach more and more users.

You can start right now by reading [related Wiki page](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/wiki/HowTo:-Translations).



### Artwork

You can contribute also without writing a single line of code. Are you feeling inspired? Submit a [color scheme](#color-schemes)
or an [icon](#icons). Don't forget to clarify its [license](artwork-license)

#### Color Schemes

Did you create a nice color scheme for Multiload-ng, and you'd like to share it with the world? Well, you should do it!

Export your color scheme from Multiload-ng, and submit to [mr.udda@gmail.com](mailto:mr.udda@gmail.com) or via pull request.
Also provide the following information:
- A name for your color scheme, if you have one
- Any inspiration/description that comes to your mind
- Your name (for the credits) and email or other contact info (optional, but recommended)

If the color scheme is original enough, it might be builtin in a future release!
Even if it's not, don't worry: your work is valuable and won't get ignored.
If color scheme submissions begin to increase, there could be an online "user repository", in which
users put their color schemes and those with most votes become part of official color schemes (like Arch's AUR).



#### Icons

Since its birth, Multiload-ng lacks a distinctive **icon** (in fact it uses the standard icon `utilities-system-monitor`).
You can submit your own icon and it will be carefully considered. You can help even with just
a hint/suggestion on what you think a good icon should have.

Here are the requirements for icons submissions:  
- Must be **original content** (that is, created purposely for Multiload-ng, and not used anywhere else)
- Must be **properly licensed** (see [below](#artwork-license))
- Must come in standard Freedesktop icon sizes: 16x16, 24x24, 36x36, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512. Nonstandard panel size of 22x22 (used for example by Ubuntu) is appreciated too.
- Making a large icon and just shrinking it to various sizes is not enough: especially at small sizes there would be too much loss of detail.
- Smaller icons should have a 1px dark outline to compensate the loss of detail.
- A SVG (scalable) variant is appreciated.
- Should be theme-agnostic (perhaps by using Tango colors). Otherwise, there should be icons for most common GTK themes.



#### Artwork License
If you provide original work, it must come in a form usable in open source software. In short, you must license it.

This is done by explicitly stating its license when you publish/submit it.

The license you choose must be compatible for use in a GPLv2 software, like some *Creative Commons*, *GPL* itself,
or if you don't want to license it, *Public Domain* (although I suggest to not release your work without any license at all).



## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Change filter to..." not "Changes filter to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally

### C Styleguide

- Place function name and arguments in the same line. Place its return type in a separate line.
- Put opening/closing brackets of functions in separate lines.
- Indent properly, using only tabs. Tab size must be 4 spaces.
- `#include <config.h>` must be the first line in all .c files (excluding comments). Header (.h) files must not include `config.h`.
- Respect the following order in every .c/.h file. Every item must be separated from others by at least one whitespace.
	- `#include <config.h>`
	- `#include` system header files (those with angular brackets), in alphabetical order
	- `#include` local header files (those with double quotes), in alphabetical order. The only exception is that, in .c files, the corresponding header must come first (e.g. in "colors.c", the line `#include "colors.h"` must come before other local includes).
	- `#define`s and macros
	- `typedef`s and structures/unions
	- function declarations/implementations
- Header files must have an include guard:  
<pre>\#ifndef __HEADER_NAME_H
\#define __HEADER_NAME_H
(file contents)
\#endif /* __HEADER_NAME_H */
(EOF)</pre>
- Use spaces after commas.
- Use parentheses if it improves code clarity.
- Use lowercase names for functions and variables, and uppercase names for defines and macros.
- Do not add an explicit `return` at the end of `void` functions.
- Do not add `(void)` argument to function without arguments.
- Use Glib types (`gint`, `gdouble`, `gchar`, ...) when possible.
- Always use Glib printf format specifiers (like `G_GUINT64_FORMAT`) when using Glib types.
- Use `g_new0` when allocating, to avoid buffer overflows and other subtle bugs.
- Add a space between `for`, `while`, `if` and respective parentheses. Same goes for function names and function calls.
- Assume `gnu90` C dialect when you are making use of advanced C features.
- End files with a newline.

### Translations Styleguide

- Do not use indentation, especially on multiline content. Otherwise, some files (like .desktop files) won't be localized.
- Make sure to fill all metadata located at the beginning of file. This includes your name, language, and so on. Please follow format of other existing .po files.
- Do not sort strings. It is useful to have the same order in all .po files.
