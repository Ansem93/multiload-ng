# Multiload-ng

## Overview
Multiload-ng is a modern graphical system monitor. It's a near-complete rewrite of the good old GNOME multiload applet.

It supports the following panels:
- XFCE (xfce4-panel)
- LXDE (lxpanel)
- MATE (mate-panel)
- Standalone (has its own window, not embedded in any panel)

Multiload-ng can be built with GTK2 and GTK3, so can be embedded within GTK2/GTK3 builds of all the panels above.



## Features
- Draw graphs of system resources
- Very customizable
- Color schemes support
- Automatically adapts to container changes (panel or window)
- Written in pure C with few dependencies - little CPU/memory footprint
- Customizable tooltips
- Custom mouse actions

## Graphs
- **CPU GRAPH**: draws CPU usage, differentiating between User/System/Nice/IOWait.
- **MEMORY GRAPH**: draws RAM usage, differentiating between memory used by the applications (directly and through shared modules) and memory used as cache/buffers.
- **NETWORK GRAPH**: draws network I/O of every supported network interface, differentiating between input, output and local (loopback, adb, etc) traffic.
- **SWAP GRAPH** draws swap usage, when swap is present.
- **LOAD AVERAGE GRAPH**: draws load average, as returned by `uptime`.
- **DISK GRAPH**: draws Disk I/O, differentiating between read and write.
- **TEMPERATURE GRAPH**: draws temperature of the system, based on the hottest temperature detected among the supported sensors in the system.

## History
Multiload-ng started as a simple port of multiload-nandhp to lxpanel>0.7.
As I become familiar with code, I started making other little changes, and cleaning the code.
I then contacted original author, but received no reply - meanwhile the plugin continued improving.

This came to the point where the changes became many and deep, and I realized that this wasn't the same project anymore.
I knew that a fresh start would give a boost to development, and at the same time it
would allow to choose future directions with more ease.

For the above reasons, I made Multiload-ng a separate project.
The name changes too (so the filenames), in order to allow them to be installed together.



## System Requirements
#### Common requirements
These are the packages required to build any version of the plugin.
See per-panel section below for full list.

Package                     | Min version
:-------------------------- | -------------:
gtk+                        | >= 2.18.0
cairo                       | >= 1.0
libgtop                     | >= 2.11.92

#### Requirements for standalone window
Standalone target has no additional requirements.

#### Requirements for LXDE panel
In addition to common requirements (see above)
these packages are required to build LXDE panel plugin:

Package                     | Min version
:-------------------------- | -------------:
lxpanel                     | >= 0.7.0
libfm                       | >= 1.2.0

Due to an error in lxpanel source, if you are using lxpanel 0.7.0 you will
need also libmenu-cache. This was fixed in version 0.7.1. Read about this
[here](http://wiki.lxde.org/en/How_to_write_plugins_for_LXPanel#Preconditions).

Note that LXDE 0.7 or greater is required.

#### Requirements for MATE panel
In addition to common requirements (see above)
these packages are required to build MATE panel plugin:

Package                     | Min version
:-------------------------- | -------------:
libmatepanelapplet-4        | >= 1.7.0

Note that MATE 1.7 or greater is required.

#### Requirements for XFCE panel
In addition to common requirements (see above)
these packages are required to build XFCE panel plugin:

Package                     | Min version
:-------------------------- | -------------:
libxfce4panel               | >= 4.6.0
libxfce4util                | >= 4.6.0
libxfce4ui-1 OR libxfcegui4 | >= 4.8.0

Note that XFCE 4.6 or greater is required.

#### Requirements for temperature graph
This is not a build-time requirement, rather a run-time one. The plugin search
sysfs nodes corresponding to thermal zones, chooses the hottest one and draws it
in the graph. The only requirement here is a Linux kernel compiled with
`CONFIG_THERMAL (Generic Thermal sysfs driver)`. Any modern kernel (since 2010)
sets it automatically, so it should be just fine.




## Build instructions

#### Get the source
Execute the following command line (you must have git installed):  
`git clone https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng`

If you don't have git, download the lastest source ZIP [here](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/archive/master.zip).

Or, if you don't want any surprise, download a stable release [here](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/releases).

#### Configure
Move to the directory that contains source code just cloned and run:  
`./autogen.sh`

Now run configure script:  
`./configure --prefix=/usr`  
Change prefix as needed (/usr is the default of most distros and it's just OK; if not specified it defaults to /usr/local).

Lubuntu users (and possibly others) have different libraries location. They may have to set directly *libdir*:  
`./configure --libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`  
If plugin does not show up in the list of panel plugins, you could try to repeat build process with this configure setting.

#### GTK version
Build system automatically selects highest GTK+ version available. If you need to build against a lower version, you have to
set it manually (see next section, **Advanced configure**)

For example, XFCE and LXDE users need GTK2 version of the plugin. They need to add option `--with-gtk=2.0` to *./configure*.

#### Advanced configure
If you are ok with default settings, you can skip this paragraph and head to **Build** section. Otherwise, continue reading.

Configure script automatically detects installed panels (and related development packages) and enables panel plugins accordingly. You can force enable/disable them using `--with-PLUGIN`, `--without-PLUGIN` or `--with-PLUGIN=yes|no` (replace `PLUGIN` accordingly)

Multiload-ng's ./configure has some extra options:  

Option                      | Description                          | Note
--------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------
`--with-gtk=2.0|3.0|auto`   | GTK+ version to compile against      | Remember to set same GTK+ version of the target panel! Otherwise you could get linking or runtime errors.
`--disable-deprecations`    | Disable GDK/GTK deprecation warnings | Useful when build system enforces *-Werror*. Some deprecated symbols does not have adequate replacement yet.
`--enable-experimental`     | Compile in experimental code         | May be unstable/malfunctioning. Only for testing/developing purposes.
`--enable-debug`            | Allows debugging with GDB            | This enables required CFLAGS.
`--enable-profiling`        | Allows profiling with gprof          | This enables required CFLAGS

To get a list of all available options, type:  
`./configure --help`

When you are satisfied with your flags, run `./configure` with selected options.

#### Build
This is simple. Move to the directory that contains source code and execute:  
`make`

#### Install/uninstall
To install (must run `make` before), execute:  
`sudo make install`

To later uninstall you need source directory. If you deleted it, just download again, and run *Configure* part. Then execute:  
`sudo make uninstall`

## FAQ

#### Q: Which are the differences with original Multiload applet?
A: First of all, this project is *forked* from original Multiload. Multiload-ng has ALL the features of the original multiload, since they share the same codebase.

There are some notable differences:

* Original multiload contains old and unmantained code, Multiload-ng is actively mantained
* Multiload-ng has a [Wiki](../../wiki)!
* Multiload-ng runs on a variety of panels, including those of the original multiload
* Multiload-ng has additional graphs, and more will be added in the future
* Multiload-ng has more graphical customizations, like individual size/interval/border
* Multiload-ng has color schemes support
* Multiload-ng responds to mouse events with per-graph customizable actions
* Multiload-ng can choose its orientation regardless of panel orientation
* Multiload-ng has higher limits for graph size and update interval
* Multiload-ng can also be run without any panel
* ...and so on

Try it in your system and you won't come back!

#### Q: I tried to compile plugin for *\[insertyourpanelhere\]*, but it shows just a vertical blank line. Why?
A: Probably you compiled against the wrong GTK version. E.g: XFCE and LXDE panels are still GTK2-based, and
Multiload-ng build system automatically selects GTK3 if available.

Try running Configure with the right options (see *Configure* section above)

#### Q: Doesn't a system monitor use system resources by itself?
A: Yes. This is true for every system monitor. That's why resources usage from Multiload-ng is kept to a negligible level.

#### Q: I found a bug! How can I report?
A: The preferred way to report a bug is by [creating a new issue](../../issues/new).

First, check wether the bug is already present in [issues list](../../issues) or in the appropriate [wiki page](../../wiki/Known-issues-and-TODO).
If it's not, you should [create a new issue](../../issues/new).

#### Q: I have a suggestion that could be useful. How can I report?
A: The preferred way to suggest a new features is by [creating a new issue](../../issues/new).

First, check wether your suggestion is already present in [issues list](../../issues) or in the project [Wishlist](../../wiki/Wishlist).
If it's not, you should [create a new issue](../../issues/new).

#### Q: Will you continue the development of Multiload-ng?
A: Of course! To get an idea of future directions, take a look at the [Wishlist](../../wiki/Wishlist).

#### Q: Why don't you port to panel *\[insertyourpanelhere\]*?
A: Because of a number of reasons:

1. I don't have the time -> Will be done when I find some time
2. I don't have required knowledge -> Will be done when I learn it
3. I didn't know that *\[insertyourpanelhere\]* existed/supported plugins -> Now I know, I'll investigate and eventually you will have your plugin
4. Requires too much work -> If it's worth it, see #1
5. Requires plugins to be written in languages other than C -> Sorry, this would break ALL existing plugins. Unless special cases (like supersets of C or simple wrappers), it's very likely it can't be done.

The best way to get a new port is to suggest it (or code it yourself, of course). Feel free to submit an issue about your request, it will be considered carefully.
