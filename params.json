  "body": "# Multiload-ng\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nMultiload-ng is a near-complete rewrite of the good old GNOME multiload applet.\r\n<!--TODO plugin screenshots, into all panels - change shape and colors too, to illustrate every possibility-->\r\n<!--TODO screenshot of preferences window too-->\r\nIt has plugins for the following panels:\r\n- XFCE 4 (xfce4-panel)\r\n- LXDE (lxpanel)\r\n- MATE (mate-panel)\r\n\r\nIn addition it can be built as a standalone window, that is, not embedded in any panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Draw graphs of system resources\r\n- Very customizable\r\n- Automatically adapts to container changes (panel or window)\r\n- Written in pure C with few dependencies - little CPU/memory footprint\r\n- Custom actions on double click\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Graphs\r\n#### CPU Graph\r\nDraws CPU usage, differentiating between User/System/Nice/IOWait.\r\n#### Memory Graph\r\nDraws RAM usage, differentiating between memory used by the applications\r\n(directly and through shared modules) and memory used as cache/buffers.\r\n#### Network Graph\r\nDraws network I/O of every supported network interface, differentiating\r\nbetween input, output and local (loopback, adb, etc) traffic.\r\n#### Swap Graph\r\nDraws swap usage, when detected.\r\n#### Load Average Graph\r\nDraws load average, as returned by `uptime`.\r\n#### Disk Graph\r\nDraws Disk I/O, differentiating between read and write.\r\n#### Temperature Graph\r\nDraws temperature of the system, based on the hottest temperature\r\ndetected among the supported sensors in the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## System Requirements\r\n#### Common requirements\r\nThese are the packages required to build any version of the plugin.\r\nSee per-panel section below for full list.\r\n\r\nPackage                     | Min version\r\n:-------------------------- | -------------:\r\nGTK+                        | >= 2.18.0\r\nCairo                       | (shipped with GTK)\r\nLibGTop                     | >= 2.11.92\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for XFCE4 panel\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build XFCE4 panel plugin:\r\n\r\nPackage                     | Min version\r\n:-------------------------- | -------------:\r\nlibxfce4panel               | >= 4.6.0\r\nlibxfce4util                | >= 4.6.0\r\nlibxfce4ui-1 OR libxfcegui4 | >= 4.8.0\r\n\r\nNote that XFCE 4.6 or greater is required.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for LXDE panel\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build LXDE panel plugin:\r\n\r\nPackage                     | Min version\r\n:-------------------------- | -------------:\r\nlxpanel                     | >= 0.7\r\nlibmenu-cache               | (Required by lxpanel)\r\n\r\nNote that LXDE 0.7 or greater is required.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for MATE panel\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build MATE panel plugin:\r\n\r\nPackage                     | Min version\r\n:-------------------------- | -------------:\r\nlibmatepanelapplet-4        | >= 1.7.0\r\n\r\nNote that MATE 1.7 or greater is required.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for temperature graph\r\nThis is not a build-time requirement, rather a run-time one. The plugin search\r\nsysfs nodes corresponding to thermal zones, chooses the hottest one and draws it\r\nin the graph. The only requirement here is a Linux kernel compiled with\r\n`CONFIG_THERMAL (Generic Thermal sysfs driver)`. Any modern kernel (since 2010)\r\nsets it automatically, so it should be just fine.\r\n",
