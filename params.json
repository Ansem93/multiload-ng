Up to 4 values will be shown together.  \r\nCan be also used to monitor changes to a file using `cat <filename>` as command line.  \r\nCan be also used to execute arbitrary shell commands using `sh -c \"<commands>\"` as command line.\r\n\r\nTooltip shows contents of command's *stderr*.\r\n\r\n### Stay tuned\r\nOther graphs are coming!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Color Schemes\r\nMultiload-ng has color scheme support, that is, every color of the graphs can be changed.\r\nThis include borders and background (two-color gradient).\r\n\r\nColors (except for border and background) have alpha values, so you can play with\r\ntransparency too!\r\n\r\nThere are also some builtin color schemes, which you can set with a single click.\r\nSome examples are present in [screenshots](#screenshots) above. Here is a partial list:\r\n- **Default color scheme** with its distinctive colors\r\n- **Tango** from [Tango Desktop Project](http://tango.freedesktop.org/)\r\n- **Solarized** by [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) in both Light and Dark variants\r\n- Color schemes inspired by famous Linux distribution: **[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)** (both Ambiance and Radiance), **[Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/)**\r\n- Color schemes inspired by famous GTK themes: **[Numix](https://numixproject.org/)** (both Light and Dark), **[Arc](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme)**\r\n- Color schemes inspired by outer space: **Moon**, **Venus**, **Earth**, **Mars**, **Jupiter**, **Uranus**, **Neptune**\r\n- Color schemes inspired by **The Simpsons** (from the work of designer [Hyo Taek Kim](http://www.hyotk.com/), watch it [here](http://www.fubiz.net/en/2015/09/19/the-colors-of-simpsons-pantone/))\r\n- Color schemes inspired by old cartoons and video games: **Dragon Ball Z**, **Super Mario Bros** (with colors from original 1985 game)\r\n- More!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## History\r\nMultiload-ng started as a simple port of multiload-nandhp to lxpanel>0.7.\r\nAs I become familiar with code, I started making other little changes, and cleaning the code.\r\nI then contacted original author, but received no reply - meanwhile the plugin continued improving.\r\n\r\nThis came to the point where the changes became many and deep, and I realized that this wasn't the same project anymore.\r\nI knew that a fresh start would give a boost to development, and at the same time it\r\nwould allow to choose future directions with more ease.\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons, I made Multiload-ng a separate project.\r\nThe name changes too (so the filenames), in order to allow them to be installed together.\r\n\r\nMultiload-ng gained popularity starting from version 1.1.0, that introduced GTK3 support. Some Linux bloggers\r\nstarted writing about the plugin, and some contributors started to send translation in their languages.\r\n\r\nAll this keeps the author motivated, and the project alive and kicking!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## System Requirements\r\n### Common requirements\r\nThese are the packages required to build any version of the plugin.\r\nSome panels may require additional packages (see below).\r\n\r\nPackage  | Min version (GTK+2)  | Min version (GTK+3)\r\n:------  | ------------------:  | ------------------:\r\ngtk+     | >= 2.20.0            | >= 3.0.0\r\ncairo    | >= 1.0               | >= 1.0\r\n\r\nMultiload-ng requires a reasonably recent Linux kernel (>2.6.36) built with\r\nspecific configuration options. These are not build-time requirement, rather\r\nrun-time ones. Here are required options:  \r\n- **CONFIG_SYSFS** *(sysfs filesystem support)*\r\n- **CONFIG_PROC_FS** *(/proc filesystem support)*\r\n\r\nIn addition, enabling the following options allows Multiload-ng to gather all possible\r\ninformations from the system. These are not strictly required, but some graphs might\r\nnot work properly, or not work at all, without these other options:  \r\n- **CONFIG_CPU_FREQ** *(CPU Frequency scaling)*\r\n- **CONFIG_POWER_SUPPLY** *(Power supply class support)*\r\n- **CONFIG_HWMON** *(Hardware Monitoring support)*\r\n- **CONFIG_THERMAL** *(Generic Thermal sysfs driver)*\r\n- __CONFIG_SENSORS_*__ - enable sensors you need\r\n\r\nAny modern kernel (since 2010) sets all these options automatically, so generally\r\nspeaking you don't have to worry about user kernels.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended building with **gcc**. Multiload-ng code is pretty standards\r\ncompliant, so it should work flawlessly with any C compiler, but using\r\ncompilers other than *gcc* is untested and it's not guaranteed to succeed.\r\n\r\n### Requirements for Application Indicator (Ubuntu Unity and others)\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build Application Indicator:\r\n\r\nPackage          | Min version\r\n:------          | ----------:\r\nlibappindicator  | >= 0.4.92\r\n\r\nCheck which GTK+ version is supported by your target panel.\r\nUbuntu Unity needs AppIndicators to be built against GTK+3.\r\nYou may have to set correct GTK+ version (see [here](#gtk-version) for instructions).\r\n\r\n### Requirements for LXDE panel\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build LXDE panel plugin:\r\n\r\nPackage        | Min version  | Notes\r\n:------        | ---:         | :----\r\nlxpanel        | >= 0.5.8     |\r\nlibmenu-cache  |              | Only for lxpanel <= 0.7.0\r\nlibfm          | 1.2.0        | Only for lxpanel >= 0.7.0\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that due to a mistake in lxpanel source, if you are using lxpanel 0.7.0\r\nyou will need both `libfm` and `libmenu-cache`. This was fixed in version 0.7.1.\r\nRead about this [here](http://wiki.lxde.org/en/How_to_write_plugins_for_LXPanel#Preconditions).\r\n\r\nYou might have to force GTK+2 build (see [here](#gtk-version) for instructions).\r\n\r\nNote that LXDE 0.5.8 or greater is required.\r\n\r\n### Requirements for MATE panel\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build MATE panel plugin:\r\n\r\nPackage               | Min version\r\n:------               | ----------:\r\nlibmatepanelapplet-4  | >= 1.7.0\r\n\r\nCheck which GTK+ version is supported by your panel: mate-panel used to be GTK+2\r\nonly, while newer versions of mate-panel are GTK+3. You may have to set correct\r\nGTK+ version (see [here](#gtk-version) for instructions).\r\n\r\nNote that MATE 1.7 or greater is required.\r\n\r\n### Requirements for XFCE panel\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build XFCE panel plugin:\r\n\r\nPackage        | Min version (GTK+2)  | Min version (GTK+3)\r\n:------        | ------------------:  | ------------------:\r\nlibxfce4panel  | >= 4.6.0             | >= 4.12.0\r\nlibxfce4util   | >= 4.6.0             | >= 4.12.0\r\n\r\nCheck which GTK+ version is supported by your panel: xfce4-panel used to be GTK+2\r\nonly, while newer versions of xfce4-panel supports GTK+3 too. You may have to set\r\ncorrect GTK+ version (see [here](#gtk-version) for instructions).\r\n\r\nNote that XFCE 4.6 or greater is required for GTK+2 plugin.\r\nNote that XFCE 4.12 or greater is required for GTK+3 plugin.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Install instructions\r\n\r\n### Package generators\r\nTake a look at [extras directory](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/tree/master/extras).\r\nThere are scripts for most Linux distributions, that generate packages which can\r\nbe then installed through package managers.\r\n\r\n### External support\r\n- For Ubuntu/Mint and derivatives, [WebUpd8 PPA](https://launchpad.net/~nilarimogard/+archive/ubuntu/webupd8) hosts **stable** packages for all supported panels.\r\nRead how to install [here](http://www.webupd8.org/2016/10/multiload-ng-140-gnome-twitch-030.html) (instructions are valid for all versions).\r\n- Arch users can get Multiload-ng from AUR. There is a separate package for each variant of the plugin.\r\nJust [search for multiload-ng in AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=n&K=multiload-ng)!\r\n\r\nIf your distro isn't covered above, or you just want to have some control over build (e.g. enable/disable some plugins, try experimental features), you can [build it yourself](#build-instructions).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Build Instructions\r\n\r\n### Get the source\r\nExecute the following command line (you must have git installed):  \r\n`git clone https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng`\r\n\r\nIf you don't have git, download the lastest source ZIP [here](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/archive/master.zip).\r\n\r\nOr, if you don't want any surprise, download a stable release [here](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/releases).\r\n\r\n### Configure\r\nMove to the directory that contains source code just cloned and run:  \r\n`./autogen.sh`\r\n\r\nNow run configure script:  \r\n`./configure --prefix=/usr`  \r\nChange prefix as needed. **/usr** is the prefix of most distros.\r\nIf you do not specify a prefix, configure script tries to infer it from installed programs. If this fails, prefix defaults to **/usr/local**.\r\n\r\n### LxPanel in systems with Multiarch support\r\nSome Linux distributions (like Debian and its derivatives) have [Multiarch](https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch) support, means that\r\nthey can install 32 bit and 64 bit libraries alongside each other.\r\n\r\nThis affects libraries location for LxPanel plugin, and it must be set manually.\r\n\r\nUsers of Multiarch-enabled systems running LxPanel (e.g. Lubuntu) have to set `libdir` directly, by adding to *./configure* the\r\noption `--libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` in 64 bit systems, and `--libdir=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu` in 32 bit systems.\r\n\r\nIf plugin does not show up in the list of LxPanel plugins, you could try to repeat build process with this configure setting.\r\n\r\n### GTK version\r\nBuild system automatically selects highest GTK+ version available. If you need to build against a lower version, you have to\r\nset it manually (see next section, [Advanced configure](#advanced-configure))\r\n\r\nFor example, LxPanel and older versions of MATE and XFCE panels need GTK2 version of the plugin.\r\nThey need to add option `--with-gtk=2.0` to *./configure*.\r\n\r\n### Advanced configure\r\nIf you are ok with default settings, you can skip this paragraph and head to [Build](#build) section. Otherwise, continue reading.\r\n\r\nConfigure script automatically detects installed panels (and related development packages) and enables panel plugins accordingly. You can force enable/disable them using `--with-PLUGIN`, `--without-PLUGIN` or `--with-PLUGIN=yes|no` (replace `PLUGIN` accordingly)\r\n\r\nMultiload-ng's ./configure has some extra options:  \r\n\r\nOption                      | Description                           | Note\r\n--------------------------- | ------------------------------------  | ---------\r\n`--with-gtk=2.0|3.0|auto`   | GTK+ version to compile against       | Remember to set same GTK+ version of the target panel! Otherwise you could get linking or runtime errors.\r\n`--disable-deprecations`    | Disable GDK/GTK deprecation warnings  | Useful when build system enforces *-Werror*. Some deprecated symbols does not have adequate replacement yet.\r\n`--enable-experimental`     | Compile in experimental code          | May be unstable/malfunctioning. Only for testing/developing purposes.\r\n`--enable-debug`            | Allows debugging with GDB             | This enables required CFLAGS.\r\n`--enable-profiling`        | Allows profiling with gprof           | This enables required CFLAGS\r\n`--disable-autostart`       | Do not install autostart entries      | Autostart entries are normally put into `/etc/xdg/autostart` for some plugins (indicator, systray...)\r\n\r\nTo get a list of all available options, type:  \r\n`./configure --help`\r\n\r\nWhen you are satisfied with your flags, run `./configure` with selected options.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\nThis is easy. Move to the directory that contains source code and execute:  \r\n`make`\r\n\r\n### Install/uninstall\r\nTo install (must run `make` before), execute:  \r\n`sudo make install`\r\n\r\nTo later uninstall you need source directory. If you deleted it, just download again, and run [Configure](#configure) part. Then execute:  \r\n`sudo make uninstall`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to Contribute\r\nRead [here](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Help & Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n### Plugin shows only a vertical blank line\r\nProbably you compiled against the wrong GTK+ version. E.g: LXDE panel and older version of MATE and XFCE panels\r\nare still based on GTK+2, and Multiload-ng build system automatically selects GTK+3 when available.\r\n\r\nTry running Configure with the right options (see [Configure](#configure) section above)\r\n\r\n### High CPU usage\r\nThis has basically two causes:  \r\n* low update interval\r\n* parametric command\r\n\r\nLowering update interval means more redraws per second. CPU usage might become noticeable on older systems.\r\n\r\nCommand line of parametric graph is called **synchronously** every time the graph is redrawn.\r\nThis means that plugins hangs waiting for the command to terminate and return numbers.\r\n\r\nYou should try to raise update interval, and try to use lightweight programs for parametric command line.\r\n\r\n### Memory usage is not the same reported by task manager\r\nThere is some disagreement on how to count some components of kernel memory. Some resource monitors\r\n(like `htop` and some graphical task managers) count them as *used* memory, while other programs\r\nlike `top` and `free` report them as *cached*.\r\n\r\nMultiload-ng now allows to choose *where* to count that memory component, in order\r\nto align memory usage value with what your favorite resource monitor reports. You can\r\nfind the switch in *Advanced Preferences* window of *Memory* graph.\r\n\r\n### Tooltips not showing reliably\r\nThis happens often on GTK+3 builds. Due to changes in the way tooltips are handled in GTK+3,\r\nsometimes they might show with big delay, or not show at all. Sometimes they do show up,\r\nbut without being updated with every graph redraw, as they should.\r\n\r\nBasically, being on GTK+ side, there is not much that can be done from Multiload-ng.\r\nSome users \"*solved*\" it by raising update interval of the graphs above\r\n*GTK+ default tooltip delay time* (500 ms in many systems).\r\n\r\nStarting from GTK+ 3.20.0, tooltips appear to be working normally.\r\n\r\n### Plugin doesn't show, and terminal is full of lines like this: `GLib-GObject-WARNING *: cannot register existing type 'GtkWidget'`\r\nYou probably selected wrong GTK+ version when building. See [GTK Version section](#gtk-version)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n### Q: Which are the differences with original Multiload applet?\r\nA: First of all, this project is *forked* from original Multiload. Nearly 100% of the code has been\r\nrewritten by now, but Multiload-ng is designed to keep ALL the features of the original multiload,\r\nand extend them.\r\n\r\nThere are some notable differences:\r\n\r\n* Original multiload contains old and unmantained code, Multiload-ng is actively mantained\r\n* Multiload-ng has a [Wiki](../../wiki)!\r\n* Multiload-ng runs on a variety of panels, including those of the original multiload\r\n* Multiload-ng does not depend on *glibtop*, meaning less bugs and less overhead\r\n* Multiload-ng detects automatically installed task manager and launches it without configuration\r\n* Multiload-ng has additional graphs, and more will be added in the future\r\n* Multiload-ng has way more graphical customizations\r\n* Multiload-ng has color schemes support\r\n* Multiload-ng responds to mouse events with per-graph customizable actions\r\n* Multiload-ng can choose its orientation regardless of panel orientation\r\n* Multiload-ng can set graphs scale manually\r\n* Multiload-ng has higher limits for graph size and update interval\r\n* Multiload-ng can also be run without any panel\r\n* Multiload-ng can filter which source to show in suitable graphs\r\n* ...and so on\r\n\r\nNot enough? Try it in your system and you won't come back!\r\n\r\n### Q: Doesn't a system monitor use system resources by itself?\r\nA: Yes. This is true for every system monitor. That's why resources usage from Multiload-ng is kept to a negligible level.\r\n\r\n### Q: I found a bug/I have a suggestion! How can I report?\r\nA: It's easy. Read [here](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n### Q: Will you continue the development of Multiload-ng?\r\nA: Of course! To get an idea of future directions, take a look at the [Wishlist](../../wiki/Wishlist).\r\n\r\n### Q: Why don't you port to panel *\\[insertyourpanelhere\\]*?\r\nA: Because of a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I don't have the time -> Will be done when I find some time\r\n2. I don't have required knowledge -> Will be done when I learn it\r\n3. I didn't know that *\\[insertyourpanelhere\\]* existed/supported plugins -> Now I know, I'll investigate and eventually you will have your plugin\r\n4. Requires too much work -> If it's worth it, see #1\r\n5. Requires plugins to be written in languages other than C -> Sorry, this would break ALL existing plugins. Unless special cases (like supersets of C or simple wrappers), it's very likely it can't be done.\r\n\r\nThe best way to get a new port is to suggest it (or code it yourself, of course). Feel free to submit an issue about your request, it will be considered carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\nAll product names, logos and brands are property of their respective owners.
